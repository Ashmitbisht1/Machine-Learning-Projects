    ##### 8. Scalability and Global Expansion:
    -	**Objective:** Scale the application to support users across different countries, ensuring compatibility with local agricultural practices, regulations, and disease profiles.
    -	**Benefit:** A globally scalable solution will provide farmers with a standardized tool for disease detection, adaptable to various climates and farming systems, driving global agricultural efficiency.

                 
    ### Results & Discussion
    ##### Model Evaluation:
    The model for plant disease detection was created using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and trained on a labelled dataset of plant leaf images. The training history indicates steady improvements in both accuracy and loss over the course of 10 epochs.
                 
    **Training Results:**
    -	**Training Loss:** The loss decreased significantly from 0.8131 in the first epoch to 0.0532 in the final epoch.
    -	**Training Accuracy:** The accuracy improved steadily, beginning at 74.81% in the first epoch and reaching 98.32% by the tenth epoch.
                 
    **Validation Results:**
    -	**Validation Loss:** The validation loss reduced from 0.4580 in the first epoch to 0.0881 by the tenth epoch.
    -	**Validation Accuracy:** The validation accuracy started at 85.40% in the first epoch and increased to 97.46% by the final epoch.
                 
    These results demonstrate the model‚Äôs effectiveness in distinguishing between healthy and diseased leaves with high accuracy and minimal error.

                 
    ##### Training Vs. Validation Performance:
    The trends in the training and validation metrics indicate effective learning without significant overfitting. The close alignment of training and validation accuracy and loss suggests that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

    **Observations:**
    -	**Consistent Improvement:** Both training and validation accuracy improved steadily with each epoch.
    -	**Decreasing Loss:** Loss values for both training and validation consistently declined, reflecting the model‚Äôs increasing ability to correctly classify plant diseases.
    -	**Validation Performance:** The validation accuracy reaching 97.46% highlights the model's robustness on unseen data.
    -	**Consistent Performance:** Validation metrics closely mirrored training metrics, signifying robust model performance on unseen data.

                 
    ##### Performance Metrics
    To evaluate the model, accuracy and loss were used as the primary metrics:
    -	**Accuracy:** Measures the proportion of correctly classified samples.
    -	**Loss:** Represents the model‚Äôs prediction error, calculated using Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss.
                 
    The loss function used is: L(y,y^) = - Œ£ci=1 yilog(y^i)
    Where:
    -	L(y,y^) is the categorical cross-entropy loss.
    -	yi is the true label (0 or 1 for each class) from one-hot encoded target vector.
    -	y^I is the predicted probability for class i.
    -	c is the number of classes.

                 
    ##### Test Results
    The trained model was evaluated on the test dataset, which consisted of unseen images of plant leaves. The performance metrics achieved during testing were:
    -	**Test Accuracy:** 97.45%
    -	**Test Loss:** 0.0881

                   
    ##### Model evaluation:
                 
    A confusion matrix was generated to evaluate the model‚Äôs performance across different classes. The results indicate high precision and recall, with minimal misclassifications across categories.

    ##### Feature Analysis
    The application of the model in a real-world scenario was tested through its primary features:
                 
    **Image Classification:**
    -	**Result:** The model reliably classified images of plant leaves into their respective categories with high accuracy.
    -	**Discussion:** Users reported satisfaction with the model‚Äôs speed and accuracy in predicting plant diseases. However, in cases of poor-quality images (e.g., blurred or poorly lit), the performance slightly declined. Future versions could include preprocessing steps, such as auto-enhancement of input images, to mitigate this issue.
